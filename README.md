## What is Santander Coders?

In essence, Santander Coders is a tech scholarship program offered by Ada Tech in collaboration with Santander. With an overwhelming response, exceeding 50,000 applicants, the program is structured into four distinct tracks: Data Science, Data Engineering, Frontend, and Backend. Out of the numerous candidates, only 300 individuals were selected, with 75 participants allocated to each track.
