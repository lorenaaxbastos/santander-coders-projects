# Unit 1 Project - Analyzing the Impact of Coaching Duration on Soccer Championship Performance

## Problem Statement

In the dynamic realm of soccer, both in Brazil and internationally, the position of a coach is particularly volatile. Teams often replace coaches following a string of negative results, but retaining a coach doesn't necessarily guarantee success. This leads to a pertinent question: do teams with longer-serving coaches, in general, achieve better final positions in the championship?

### Data

To address this question, a bunch of JSON files containing all the data from 2006-2023 Brazilian Championships will be provided.

### Expected Outcome

By the end of the project, you should have compiled data on each team's final position and the duration (in number of rounds) of the longest-serving coach. For example, the coach of the 1st-place team served for 32 rounds, the 2nd-place coach for 37 rounds, the 3rd-place coach for 29 rounds, and so forth. This data can be stored in a data structure of your preference.

With this information, create a straightforward graph where the x-axis represents the final position and the y-axis represents the duration of the longest-serving coach. This visual representation will provide insights into the potential correlation between coaching duration and championship performance.
